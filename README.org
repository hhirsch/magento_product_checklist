* How to get a product visible in the frontend
- enable the product
- set it visible in catalogue and search
- add it to the website you want it in
- add it to the category you want it in
- set the status in stock
- add a quantity to the stock
- if you run multistore make sure the settings are not overwritten by website, store group or store view settings.
- reindex all. If the product still does not show up make sure to use *php shell/indexer.php --reindex all* to reindex. Because magerun will stop reindexing if one index throws an error.
** Bundled Product
- have simple products enabled and asociated to the bundle
